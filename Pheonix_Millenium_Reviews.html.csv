Arun Kumar,"Local Guide ¬∑ 315 reviews ¬∑ 2,084 photos",4 stars,4 months ago,"I recently visited Phoenix Mall in Wakad and had a great experience overall. The mall is spacious, clean, and offers plethora of shopping options with aesthetic infrastructure. One can find  high-end brands to affordable choices. The food court has a good variety of eateries catering to different tastes, and the ambiance is lively.

The mall is easily accessible with ample parking space, which is a huge plus. The cinema experience here is also fantastic, and I enjoyed watching a movie in their comfortable theatres.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the crowd can sometimes be overwhelming, especially on weekends. It would be great if the management could work on crowd management during peak hours.

Only emergency exits are marked correctly. Entrance to the mall is blocked, pedestrians have very narrow passage for entry. You guys should see amanora and seasons mall, entry to the mall and parking management. They have big passages but block pedestrians from using them. All our people see is the interior but no one sees ease of parking and entry to the mall. The society in front has no parking boards, I see all the vehicles parked outside of the mall.

anil sharma,Local Guide ¬∑ 56 reviews ¬∑ 172 photos,4 stars,a week ago,"I had visited Phoenix Mall of the Millennium in Wakad, Pune some time ago. It was a nice experience overall.

The mall is big, clean, and has a modern look. There are many shops for clothes, shoes, electronics, and more. I liked the variety of brands available ‚Äì from budget to premium. Overall it feels a little bit expensive. The food court is spacious and has many options like pizzas, burgers, Indian food, and desserts.

The mall also has a multiplex for watching movies and some fun play zones for kids. There are many places to sit and relax inside. The washrooms were clean and easy to find. Security and staff were helpful and polite.

Parking is available but it can get full on weekends. There was a bit of crowd, but the mall is large so it didn‚Äôt feel too packed.

Do‚Äôs:

-Wear comfortable clothes and shoes, as the mall is big and you may walk a lot.
-Visit during weekdays if you want to avoid the crowd.
-Keep your phone and wallet safe, especially in crowded areas.
-Try different food items in the food court ‚Äì there‚Äôs good variety.

Don‚Äôts:
-Don‚Äôt park in no-parking areas outside the mall ‚Äì you may get fined.
-Don‚Äôt bring big bags, as they may be checked at the entrance.
-Don‚Äôt litter. Use dustbins provided.

Improvements:
-The mall can improve by adding more sitting areas near shops.
-Signboards for directions inside the mall can also be clearer. -Some parts the AC was not working well.

Overall it is a great place for shopping, food, and fun with family or friends. And don't expect too many discounts.",,,,

Most of the national and international brands in lifestyle, fashion, ethnic wear, apparels, home decor, foods, shoes, super store etc. are available here. Great ambiance with multiplex is all in one Stop destination for people. Nice decoration and plenty of sitting arrangement is appreciated üëç

Huge 6 floors of mall for shopping and entertainment. Sign board for washroom and elevator needs to improve as all folks don't understand the picture only. So there should be written signboard as well for suitable for all kinds of visitors.

Similar huge multi floor parking area with mechanical smart car parking system to accommodate many vehicles. Lots of food options indian, South Indian, north indian, fast food and other traditional maharashtrian and jain options are available. Big brands Pizza Hut, Domino's, McDonald's, Buggies burger, WOW Chinese, KFC and many more.

Only problem is narrow approach road to mall and residential area around makes lots of time waste in parking queues. Be aware unauthorised parking outside of the mall (2 W and 4W) end up in towing by Traffic.

The escalators are placed well. There is a good collection of items in various shops. Major shopping needs clothing, footwear, jewellery, electronics, can be fulfilled in this one place.
However, the mall parking, especially for the cars is a big no-no. It takes hours to get your car parked in the parking and same while you want to leave.

Vijay Verghis,"Local Guide ¬∑ 391 reviews ¬∑ 4,435 photos",4 stars,a year ago,One of the largest malls in pune at waked. They have spent a lot of attention to the interiors and yes it definitely looks and feels premium. They have a lot of brands here and some really good deals were on for the Christmas season. The food court has a variety of food options just like the other malls. The stand alone restaurants are only a few and I assume they are still to open. They have the time zone and fun city which are amazing entertainment options for your kids. Time zone has a 4 lane bowling track and some 3d games to play for both kids and adults. I have given them a 4 only because of the parking and bad management. Half the staff are not disciplined and with no training. It will be a mess and you will find the staff sending you in the wrong direction. Washrooms can be kept more cleaner. I believe they will eventually get it right. Good option to visit in the Pune Bangalore highway. Watch out for the traffic jams while entering and exiting the mall. I will visit again.,7,,,

Phoenix Mall of Millennium in Wakad is an amazing destination for shopping and leisure. The mall is huge with a beautifully designed interior, filled with stunning decor pieces that make for great photo spots. It's a visual treat for anyone who loves a well-done interior.

You‚Äôll find all the major brands here, like H&M, Adidas, Arrow, Azorte, Biba, Bluestone, Casio, Croma, Crossword, and many more. It's the perfect shopping destination, offering something for everyone. The food court is equally impressive, with a wide variety of food options from popular brands to choose from.

However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The parking situation for 4-wheelers can be a hassle, and the mall is almost always crowded. Weekends, in particular, are super busy, with heavy traffic and lots of people. If you want a more relaxed experience, it's best to avoid weekends.

My personal experience of wasting 30 min walking n searching for correct lift and the lift workers are so ride that they leave you at B1 and says take other lift or use staircase for B2 and offs the lift just to go from work and I'm left with serching for right lift going here n there as per the instructions of the mall workers.

They have all the major brands and various restaurants and food courts.
The food court has been decorated with Forest theme

Inox Multiplex is one of the biggest in pune and have maximum number of screens around 18 screens.

They have multiple play areas for children

Still a lot of area in under construction and more brands are coming to the mall

5. On the mezzanine floor ,lots of artifacts are for your visual delight.

Misba Sayyed,Local Guide ¬∑ 86 reviews ¬∑ 225 photos,4 stars,a year ago,"A gigantic mall. A lot of brands and variety of food outlets are available here. A bit too crowdy on weekends as it is a new mall in the town. A bit tedious as parking for two wheelers have different entry. Water fountain, lightings, etc are very eye catchy and pretty. It looks very beautiful at night. The mall is huge so there is a lot of walking if you plan to bring senior citizens though there are a lot of resting / seating places available. Two game zones are available and perfect for kids. Washrooms are clean. The mall is very beautiful inside out.",3,,,

So....The Phoenix Mall of the Millennium is bit close to my heart as i have been the part of it's construction process in little bit mine contribution.
I visited the mall 2 days back and to say about the mall, it's just FAB üëå.
It's a 3-4 floor mall, with spectacular interior as well as the exterior of the mall.
At the entry of mall you will get to see the musical fountains which is a good attraction spot for audience.
To talk about Insight of mall, at every floor you will get a picture click spot.
Still the mall is not yet opened to full capacity but its a great place to hangout with friends.
Note: Don't visit the mall on weekends it's fully crowded.

However, one thing that disappointed me was the lack of seating arrangements. When visiting with elderly family members or even after walking and shopping for a while, it's essential to have a place to sit and rest. It's surprising and unfortunate that such a basic amenity is missing in a well-maintained mall like this. I hope the management considers adding seating areas for the convenience of visitors.

There was only one female cashier available who was handling everything alone, and as a result, the queue was long and customers were getting frustrated.
What disappointed me even more was when the cashier politely requested for more staff support, the manager reacted rudely instead of helping. As a customer, I found this very unprofessional and unfair towards both the staff and us waiting customers.
I request you to kindly look into this matter and ensure better staff management during busy hours. A little support and coordination can make the experience smoother for everyone.",,,,

The Phoenix Mall of the Millennium in Wakad is poised to become a crown jewel in the PCMC area. While it's not yet fully operational, glimpses of its stunning design hint at a truly impressive shopping experience.

This mall isn't just big, it's enormous. it will be a one-stop destination for everything from fashion and electronics to entertainment and dining.

But the Phoenix Mall of the Millennium isn't just about scale. The architectural design itself is generating a lot of buzz. a modern and stylish aesthetic that will create a memorable atmosphere for visitors.

siddharth mishra,Local Guide ¬∑ 17 reviews,2 stars,2 months ago,"I recently visited the Mall of the Millennium, expecting a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience. Unfortunately, my visit was marred by two significant issues.

Firstly, I used the hydraulic parking facility, which damaged my car's antenna. I hope the mall management takes steps to ensure that their parking facilities are safe and well-maintained.

Secondly, I was disappointed to find that the mall did not provide any pram or stroller facilities for infants. As a parent, it's essential to have access to such facilities, especially when visiting a large mall with a lot of walking involved. This lack of consideration for families with young children was surprising and inconvenient.

Overall, my experience at the Mall of the Millennium was disappointing, and I hope that the management takes my feedback seriously and makes the necessary improvements.",,Response from the owner,2 months ago,"We sincerely apologize for your experience not being up to par.

debjyoti das,"Local Guide ¬∑ 579 reviews ¬∑ 2,023 photos",3 stars,a year ago,"The mall is huge and has all the stores that you expect for a one stop shopping experience.

They have tried to make the interiors extravagant - some of which are cool while most are tacky.

There is a set of mechanised colored fountains in the front of the property which is fun for kids.

The mall is big and the first of this size in this area so the footfall is very high. There is a continuous inflow of vehicles.

The pedestrian walkway on the outside of the mall runs along the motorway with no concrete safety partition which is risky and a hazard which would account to faulty design.

There are store locators across the mall which is very helpful. The gents toilets are clean and plenty though the stalls are fitted at the wrong height - the partitions are tall enough and they could be installed higher to provide more privacy.

The mobile network coverage inside the mall is dismal and there is no guest wifi available in case you need it.

Just below the food court there a small seating area with a large curved screen where they were playing a cricket match. There is also a small podium which I believe would later be used for promotions and some performances.

Around the mall there is too much noise with a mix of fast music playing and hundreds of people talking making the environment very noisy.

There are some locations for selfies which people make good use of. The floor area of the mall is large so there is a lot of opportunities to display art and sculpture. I wish there were more seating options for visitors which I am hoping will come up once the mall is fully operational.

I am not sure the residents at the apartment complex just across the road are having a great time with all the rush that happens with a big mall. I hope that lights, music and the traffic on the small road is not becoming a daily nuisance.",1,,,

Patchitrakaar Anupam,Local Guide ¬∑ 161 reviews ¬∑ 749 photos,3 stars,a year ago,"Right off the bat, I was met with traffic on the small road. The road planning to go to this mall is not great. Cars coming from the highway side have to face a stark 90 degree right, cross the road, and go inside. Cars on the other side have to wait a lot. Chaos.

Other problem is the parking. There are close to 4-5 entries in the mall, and every where I was stopped and asked to go to 2 wheeler entry road, which absolutely nobody could tell where it was. Eventually, tired and getting hot in the sun, I decided to park on the road.

The mall construction is good, but navigation inside it is IMPOSSIBLE. there is a tablet on each floor, and it helps, but to get to it you have to walk for 200 300 meters. The boards on each floor DONOT explain properly which store is where. Infact on floor 1,i saw names of shops from floor 2. Confusing.

The whole place is like the Indraprastha. Smooth tiles which people casually fall from, reflections everywhere. Could have worked there better?

Shops are good though. The new Tim Hortons is here. It's costly, but it's just a personal opinion.

Nonas pizza place was good. They make sourdough, its awesome.

But again, navigation. Exits are not exactly clear, and it took me half an hour to get where my scooter was.

Shops are good, but the mall experience was poor for me",,,,

Well a food court does not have many options but has plenty of options such as shops of chat, Chinese, Haldiram,KFC etc etc. If you would like to see the fountain show, please visit by evening time.. It's beautiful. Avoid going on weekends as it's fully flooded with crowds or can avoid going by self vehicle as parking would be challenging. Well if you visit by weekdays then you can relax the whole time, capture photos, take videos and shop quite relaxed.

Jubin,Local Guide ¬∑ 68 reviews ¬∑ 5 photos,3 stars,5 months ago,Location of the mall isn't good. All the routes leading to the mall are always jam packed. During festival it is nightmare.People park their vehicles outside the mall leading to narrowing of road further. It takes a lot of time to entry and exit(can take upto 1 hour to exit). There is no proper management of parking. Food court is not sufficient to cater huge crowds. Elevators are always busy. Except food court there isn't a single place where you can sit inside the mall. Mall management needs to  talk to local traffic police for better traffic management .,,Response from the owner,5 months ago,"Thank you for your feedback.

It took me 1.5hrs to reach mall . They kept changing the gates of entry and the road is pathetic condition and very narrow. No planning of infrastructure to acecess the mall. Irrespective of how good or bad the mall is its of no use of the access is not planned.

No parking on the roads, additional signals and staff to manage the traffic is so crutial here...but very very disappointed.  We wanted to go back but we were stuck and had to reach the mall.

Total disappointment !!!

If u would have planned taken more time and opened the mall when everything was ready , then customers wouldnt had to suffer.

Do no plan to visit this mall fpr next 2 months and expecially on holidays or weekends. It is better to be home than to get stuck in the pathetic traffic just to reach the mall.

Shrikant Chughwani,Local Guide ¬∑ 109 reviews ¬∑ 41 photos,5 stars,a year ago,This is one of the biggest mall of Pune. Mall has multiple play zones for kids and are always full on weekends.

Parking charges are Rs. 50 for 4 wheelers. They also have valet parking for Rs 150.,,,,

Atulit Yadav,Local Guide ¬∑ 12 reviews,2 stars,5 months ago,Just creating good infrastructure is not enough. Amenities should also be operational. I have seen this many times only one lift is kept in operation during night movie shows due to which there is a lot of congestion and one has to wait a lot to get into the lift. If you cannot keep more than one lift operation then what is the point of constructing more. Please keep a note of it and I believe I would see at least two lifts to be operational till the last movie show is over.,,,,

Vijay Gupta,"Local Guide ¬∑ 472 reviews ¬∑ 3,499 photos",4 stars,4 months ago,"Just for a change and request from family to visit somewhere on new year, so planned to visit there as I heard about this new mall a lot so my expectations were high. That could be my mistake.
I reached the mall around 5.30pm and the very first challenge there was my car parking. There was no clear sign or instruction for entry towards car parking. When I reached to parking gate, I got to know that the parking gate is not opened and have to entered through other gate. I turned my car back and reached to other gate. I was wondering security guard was not    giving any indication. However I parked my vehicle at P2 some how but there were no entry from the P2 to the mall. To enter into the mall, have to go lower ground using staircase. We entered the mall on UG floor and started roaming and exploring all the floors and some of the shops. My kids were feeling hungry so I found Burger King outlet there so entered and got the table. Here my experience was very bad. Firstly, there was no order accepted on the counter so insisted on placing the order using their order placement machine and secondly, I got disappointed again as the machine was not accepting payments from any of the mode. You need to take receipt and table no. to the counter again for payment. 3rd disappointment was they were not accepting Sodexo voucher. However we had burgers and got rid of our hunger. Afterwards visited all the floors and shops then finally reached to the food court for dinner but it was fully occupied and nothing there to seat. We got out from the mall without having dinner.

Despite my disappointment, I must say the ambience and decoration was impressive though it was not big enough but good. Though it was not worth to visit from Dhanori. Marketcity mall is good than this.

I may not visit this mall again.",,Response from the owner,4 months ago,"We sincerely apologize for your experience not being up to par.

Jerome Joshi,5 reviews,4 stars,3 months ago,"I liked the ambience of the mall and enjoyed my time there, there are a range of outlets from clothing to electronics to food.

I also watched movies there once and it was a positive experience.

I had been to the food court twice. Once at Wow! China and then to The Doner Company. Both the times I didn't enjoy the sizzlers at the food court, though it was cooked fine, it wasn't what I had expected. The first time around at Wow! China, it was more of a fried rice and manchurian with a ball of smoke underneath the plate to create an illusion that it's sizzling. Also, the other food outlets stopped serving since it was getting late so I was left with only a few options.

The second time around at The Doner Company, the sizzler looked appetizing but there was hardly any chicken and only vegetables and noodles on the platter. Also, the salt in the food wasn't as expected (not sure if it was more or less but it wasn't the right amount).

We ended up spending a bomb there (upward of Rs. 1000 in total) and I wasn't satisfied with the food experience at all.",,Response from the owner,4 months ago,"We're thrilled to hear you loved the ambiance at Phoenix Mall of the Millennium!

Few times I had to return home without entering the mall, due to a huge queue, and a few times I waited in the queue for more than half an hour. Caution, weekend evenings, is complete chaos.
Recently, they have got double deck parking with mechanised lifted parking lots, that's a lot of inconvenience, you struggle a lot while parking, getting out, you may end up twisting your ankle. Plus, you have wait to get your car out if itson the upper deck. Once my car got stuck, while parking on the ramp, and ended up with a damaged door.

Manas Ranjan Sahu,Local Guide ¬∑ 15 reviews ¬∑ 1 photo,2 stars,3 months ago,"Very bad arrangements for two wheeler parking. Takes around 30+ mins after the entry gate to pass the token collection gate and the price collected is INR 30 and unlike other malls it can't be reimbursed against shopping in any store there.

Also in the arcade games arena, you can't pay for one game and play it. You have to reload a full card with 11 plays for INR 1600 ""only"", and the validity is just some days. So if you're coming once or are an outsider or living in PMC, you can't make your kids enjoy 1-2 games other than if you've come in a big group so that you can distribute the 'packaged' games within the kids in your group.

Nothing attractive other than a big mall with many shops. Seems to have opened the mall and are using the parking fees to offset the running cost.

Give it a miss or if you're not going in a group you can do timepass.",,Response from the owner,3 months ago,"We're genuinely sorry to hear about your parking experience.

akshay jethani,8 reviews,1 star,4 months ago,"Worst security check at Inox PVR at Phoenix mall of millennium. I had the worst experience ever and it was really harassing and scary, until me and my wife rushed our vehicle and got safely back to our home.

We booked movie ticket for game changer movie the show started at 10:45 and after 15 mins 5 men entered in our row fully drunk and they were stinking really bad. We literally got up and moved to other seats. They were sitting on our booked seat later. We tried to inform security guards at the theatre entrance that we think they do not have a valid ticket and they are really drunk and stinking please help us out. Six security guards came in the Audi to check and talked to them for 5 minutes and later no action was taken. They were still occupying the whole row and everyone had to move out of the row ultimately.

Was hoping the security of such a great and huge mall to be at least strong enough to take an action on this immediately.",,Response from the owner,4 months ago,"We sincerely apologize for your experience not being up to par.

Beyond shopping, Phoenix Marketcity stands out for its diverse dining options.

This mall houses many reputed brands like Starbucks, Marks and Spencer, INOX IMAX, Pantaloons, Home Centre, Croma etc. More brands will follow. The biggest advantage is the location of the mall. It falls slightly on the inside off the Pune Mumbai Highway but not that deep also. The traffic is slowly increasing in the surrounding areas and can be a major problem in future.

Suraj Padle,Local Guide ¬∑ 188 reviews ¬∑ 872 photos,5 stars,11 months ago,"Finally a mall of this size and class is a boon to west Pune. We are regulars to this mall and it caters to all age groups. The food court is huge and with a lot of seating yet very crowded on weekends but that is just because the food outlets are really good and offer a wide variety of cuisine. For a better experience visiting on weekdays is more advisable. The signboards are the only let down as they are confusing especially the ones next to the escalators. The shopping experience is great as you can name a brand and it has a store in this mall. The parking management is much better than before but there is still scope for improvement. The exit part is the most time consuming as the fast tag or manual billing is slow.
They should station more people on each floor with a desk to guide people and definitely improve the signage.
The seasonal displays are top notch.

Hope you maintain the same and improve on the services.",,Response from the owner,11 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience!

Farzad Dastoor,Local Guide ¬∑ 33 reviews,1 star,6 months ago,"The mall is ok. it has a good fountain, good food and some unique brands. The parking was a nightmare.

I went on Sunday Afternoon at 1 pm. The approach road was blocked. i spent 25 mins to get to the gate of the mall. The mall parking was very less. I spent 35 mins to wait in line and park my vehicle. I left at around 9:30 pm and it took me 20 mins in line to pay for the parking on my exit. The parking person had a hand held fast tag device which he clearly did not know how to use. He banged the device on the screen of my car at least 6-7 times as he was not able to read the tag. He was not able to tell me how much money he is cutting in the fast tag also.
I think such huge malls should have distinct multiple entry and exit points with adequate parking.

Two wheeler parking is only from one gate which is in the sayaji lane not from the main gate",,Response from the owner,10 months ago,"We regret to hear about your Unsatisfactory experience at our mall.

Bhavya Singhal,Local Guide ¬∑ 77 reviews ¬∑ 18 photos,3 stars,9 months ago,"Most of reviews by the users here are based on the aura of the new mall and the satisfaction it is giving to the people living nearby. However comparing with other equivalent malls it has its own goods and bad. For example - number of escalators are good which has both up and down at the same point, unlike malls like Elpro where escalator to go up or down is always in opposite corners of the mall.
Washrooms here are big able to handle the crowd.
Food court ambience is good but to achieve that they have killed the count of tables, which now always makes it a struggle to get a table during peak times. However who wants to eat at odd times anyhow.
Since the mall is in a circle shape from inside, there is no easy way to go to the opposite side of the circle. One has to go round. A simple cut in between like mall of India in Noida would have been helpful. Seating space is only there for restaurants and food courts, ideally there is lot of space unutilized, where they can keep benches for people with kids.
Lot of reviews are here for inadequate parking. But people are spending lot of time to shop and eat here if we compare with other malls. However mall has decent parking space and capacity to hold the crowd. Number of lifts could have been increased.
Separate pick and drop for Ola Uber or Auto may help avoiding the traffic at the gate.
Been here more than a dozen times now, FASTag facility never worked even once for both of my cars. Security is sub standard, when compared to westend or pavilion mall. During peak rush they tend to miss the inspection of cars and people.

Overall this mall is a good shopping option but only on weekdays.",,Response from the owner,9 months ago,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience!

Specially on weekends and holidays.
Ambience is cool.
Water shows are lovely.
If you are going this place. Prefer going by a cab , try to avoid taking your own vehicle, specially if you have a movie booked here. Otherwise you'll definitely miss a lot of you movies beginning .
It has a stadium where when no shows are going on people just sit and enjoy.
Angel wings to get yourself clicked with.
Food court and theatres are good. Its new mall so has latest technologies , everything looks lovely",1,,,

The highlight of the mall is undoubtedly the INOX cinema, which offers top-notch entertainment with its state-of-the-art facilities and a wide selection of movies. The comfortable seating and excellent sound quality ensure a memorable movie-watching experience.

While the food court's aesthetics are commendable, I would hesitate to recommend it for food. Despite its attractive appearance, the quality and variety of food options may not meet everyone's expectations.

Sitting area for food court , however, I found a little small.

The cafes though, balance that . Premium cafes n bar with pinteresty vibes are there.

For shopping- every big n small brand we can find there. Some are upcoming also..

Parking is spacious. But I missed the clarity in signs leading in n out of the parking area.
One good thing is that, parking charges are deducted through your fastag and you dint have to to deal with parking slip n  cash issues.

The lighting is totally worthy n beautiful while entering or exiting. Beautiful , in- motion flamingos are seen everywhere.

Washrooms are hygenically maintained and tidy.

However, I have concerns regarding the mall‚Äôs impact on the neighboring residential area. The primary issue lies in the parking management. Entering the mall‚Äôs parking lot is a slow process, causing traffic jams on the already narrow roads. Additionally, there is a significant problem with two-wheeler parking. The mall‚Äôs security does not take action when visitors park their two-wheelers on the footpath, which should be reserved for pedestrians. This has led to a habitual inconvenience for the residents as the footpaths on both the front side and back gate of the mall are often blocked by parked vehicles.

Cons-
Access to parking has traffic issues which wont solve anytime soon so plan your travel during nonpeak hours
Very small seating arrangement to have food, such a big mall and this limitation is certainly very badly planned and careless for customers. On holidays you won't even get lot of food options as we found out of stock most items in the food court.
Very small entertainment area and not a lot of events.

Shubham Kumbhar,Local Guide ¬∑ 113 reviews ¬∑ 213 photos,5 stars,a year ago,"Phoenix Mall offers an absolutely delightful shopping experience. The moment you step inside, you're greeted by a wide and enticing array of stores, catering to all tastes and budgets. The spacious layout and meticulously designed interiors make it exceptionally easy to navigate, even during the busiest peak hours.

One of the mall's standout features is its incredibly diverse dining options. Whether you're in the mood for exquisite international cuisine, indulgent fast food, or a quick and satisfying coffee break, there's truly something to satisfy every palate. The food court buzzes with an impressive array of choices, and the restaurants offer a charming and inviting atmosphere for a sit-down meal.

Shopping enthusiasts will undoubtedly revel in the splendid variety of high-end brands and stores available. From opulent fashion boutiques to essential everyday retailers, Phoenix Mall truly leaves no shopper's desire unfulfilled. Frequent sales and discounts add an extra layer of allure, making it an unbeatable destination for bargain hunters.

Entertainment options are equally abundant and enthralling. The state-of-the-art multiplex cinema screens the very latest releases, ensuring a captivating cinematic experience. Meanwhile, the arcade and play areas provide endless fun for families, creating unforgettable moments. Additionally, the parking facilities are not only generally ample but also impeccably well-maintained.

The only minor drawback one might encounter is the mall's tremendous popularity, which occasionally results in sizable crowds, especially during weekends. However, this very popularity stands as a testament to its exceptional charm and the unparalleled shopping and dining experiences it consistently delivers.",1,,,

Sibu Nepak,Local Guide ¬∑ 182 reviews ¬∑ 320 photos,4 stars,9 months ago,"Though the mall opened to public sometime in August a lot of outlets are not yet fully functional. Unlike the Nagar Road Phoenix the layout is not so confusing. They have plenty of parking space.  One other challenge is the approach roads to the mall (from Wakad) that are still under construction at many places (October 2023); Google Maps might give you wrong direction.

Updating review after a year:

Posh and a high-end mall . A lot has already been said by others. Don't  want to repeat. The reason it continues at 4 start is, it's  always a struggle to get into the parking lot. Autos block almost the two left most lanes. Traffic stewards are helpless and ineffective. And then all the civilized mall going smart ones trying to somehow get into the entry gate like headless chicken as if they have not been to a mall before. Finally, in such a huge mall they don't have sitting arrangements on the floors, have seen pregnant women, elderly people and young parents struggling to keep walking/standing long hours. Put a few flat benches - it's a basic thing the mall owner could have done.",,Response from the owner,9 months ago,"Thank you for your feedback and for updating your review!

Benji Johnson,"Local Guide ¬∑ 199 reviews ¬∑ 1,529 photos",1 star,8 months ago,"Had a terrible experience at the Unicorn store in Phoenix, Wakad and they call themselves Apple ""Premium"" reseller. But their service and the overall experience in my interactions with them has been worse than a local phone shop. I have issues after issues with them. I remember visiting the OnePlus showroom and seeing more educated people there.

Issue 1: I went to purchase an iPhone 15 for my wife. On Sep 16. I asked about CC cashback and no cost EMI and the staff (Ms. Sumaya something I believe) said that we can avail those offers. Only to find out, at the billing desk that both of those weren't available.

Issue 2: The staff was just trying to get rid of us soon. We mentioned that data-wise, photos and WhatsApp history only was very important and that we backed up those to the cloud. It is the duty of the floor staff, who are apparently supposed to be well trained, to educate the customer, that WhatsApp on Android backs up dara on Google Drive and iOS retrieves backup only from iCloud. She didn't even take my consent when she selected what to back up from the Android via Move to iOS app. I have to start from scratch on iOS now without my decades worth of chat history. And for my wife's work, it was absolutely critical. In OnePlus store, I've had a much more premium experience!!!!

Issue 3: I had pre-booked an iPhone 16 (black, 256gb) as well. I had pre-booked on the day it was opened (Sep 13). After 6 days,  and one day before the official launch (today), I get an sms from a private unofficial number saying that the phone is unavailable because the ""perticular model and color"" (notice the incorrect grammar) is not available in stock. No regret or apologies for the inconvenience in that message. And no expectation setting on when i should be able to pick it up. I am pretty sure they're prioritising their personal contacts before mine.

If this is the level of service I'm getting pre-sales, I don't mind losing my ‚Çπ1,000 pre-booking amount, but I'm going to purchase my phone from Reliance or Croma.

Moral of the story: If you want a substandard, street shopping experience, please visit Unicorn Store in Phoenix Mall of the Millennium, Wakad.",,,,

They must have some trained people who can take care of the situation when people are coming in big numbers with their vehicles.",5,,,

Huge car parking.
Downside is you don't understand where the 2 wheeler parking is / it's a bit at the other side / en entrance which we didn't get so we paid and parked nearby ground locally where most of the 2 wheelers were getting parked for 30/- till 10 pm only.

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Phoenix Mall of the Millennium in Pune, and it left a lasting impression. The grandeur of the mall's architecture is truly commendable, providing a delightful backdrop to a memorable shopping experience.

Despite being a new addition to Pune's shopping scene, the mall's charm is undeniable. Although some shops are yet to open, the promise of a diverse shopping experience is evident. The spacious layout and modern design make navigating the mall a breeze, and the potential for a wide range of stores adds anticipation to future visits.

What stood out to me was the thoughtful mix of local and global brands, catering to diverse tastes. The ambiance is inviting, and it's clear that this mall has the potential to become a bustling hub for both locals and visitors.

While my visit coincided with the initial stages of the mall's operation, I could already envision Phoenix Mall of the Millennium becoming a go-to destination for shopping, entertainment, and relaxation in Pune.

For some unknown reason ( satisfactory reason was not given upon asking ) your Fastag is scanned at the entrance of the parking..
The moment you exit the mall you are in for a surprise... The Fastag scanner doesn't work and you have to pay via other options..

Rakesh Gavali,Local Guide ¬∑ 27 reviews ¬∑ 67 photos,3 stars,a year ago,"The Phoenix Mall of Millenium is undeniably a beautiful and vibrant shopping destination. With its wide array of food options and diverse range of shopping outlets, it offers something for everyone. The mall is a shopper's paradise, with numerous stores and boutiques to explore, and a plethora of dining choices to satisfy any craving.

However, the mall's popularity has led to significant issues with overcrowding. During peak hours, the sheer volume of visitors can be overwhelming, making it challenging to navigate through the bustling crowds. This overcrowding also extends to the parking situation, as finding a spot can be a daunting task. Additionally, the high volume of traffic in the area due to the mall's popularity often leads to frustrating jams and delays.

While the Phoenix Mall of Millenium offers an extensive selection of amenities, the issues of overcrowding, limited parking availability, and traffic congestion can detract from the overall experience. Visitors should be prepared to navigate through large crowds and consider alternative transportation options when planning a visit.",1,,,

One is a Japanese Brand shop (sorry I forgot the name of the store) which is on the second floor. They sell quite unique items. Flower and herb fragrance showergels, and other things unique to Japan.
Another is a Hair Care and Hand  store which has right now so many fragrances and they even have testers to try if you like. They right now have a sale going on which predictably, made us shop quite a lot of stuff.
For food, again all Brands have their presence. Including an Amul Icecream parlour, wow. I would definitely suggest a visit to Nona's Pizza. The Pizzas are excellent. We tried two of them and both lovely. The croquets were yummy. So was their Nona's cooler (drink) fabulous.

Lots of vehicles were kept near entry and drop off area so that queue is created to enter parking. I had an argument with the person handling parking as valet person deliberately kept me waiting at the drop off area. He also made me wait to enter parking area for 10 min. Which again created queue at entry point forcing visitors to opt for valet. Mall has created huge parking area but this mismanagement of parking is creating chaos and creating bad image of the mall.

I recently visited the Phoenix Mall of Millennium in Wauquad and was highly disappointed with the facilities provided in the feeding room. The room had only a single chair for sitting, which is inadequate for the number of mothers needing to use it. Moreover, there was no air conditioning or fan, making the room unbearably hot and uncomfortable.

To add to the inconvenience, many mothers, including visitors from abroad, were forced to wait outside the room. Shockingly, the security personnel were asking mothers to sit on the floor to feed their babies. For those who refused, they were given a mere two-minute time limit to feed, which is completely unrealistic and unacceptable.

Overall, the feeding room facilities at Phoenix Mall of Millennium are severely lacking and need immediate improvement to accommodate the needs of all mothers comfortably and respectfully.",,Response from the owner,a year ago,"We regret to hear about your Unsatisfactory experience at our mall.

Wow, what an experience! üëè

I recently visited this mall, and I must say, it left me speechless. While not all the stores have opened yet, the overall ambiance here surpasses its Viman Nagar counterpart. The food court is a real treat, with an array of stalls featuring new brands that I've never encountered before. It's a foodie's paradise! üçîüçüüåÆ

However, a word of advice: if you plan to visit, opt for weekdays to avoid the parking nightmare we endured. We spent a good 30 minutes just waiting for a parking spot! üòì Also, brace yourself for the first two months after opening, as weekends can get insanely crowded. It's worth the visit, but plan accordingly. üóìÔ∏è

On a positive note, it's reassuring to hear that the ACP of traffic is on top of the situation, working to alleviate the traffic congestion in and around the mall. üöóüö¶ Though it may take some time for these solutions to be implemented, it's a step in the right direction.

In conclusion, this mall has the potential to be a real gem in the city, but a bit of patience is required during its initial phase. So, gather your friends, plan your visit wisely, and get ready to be amazed! üõçÔ∏èüéâ #RetailTherapy #NewHotspot",1,,,

I would say around 25% of the shops are functional as of now...Most of the brands at Phoenix Viman Nagar will have their outlets here.

The road that leads to the mall is crowded as hell. It is a nightmare to drive into so much traffic. We thought that going to Wakad Phoenix would be awesome since we stay in PCMC, but what's the point if it takes the same amount of time in which we would have reached Phoenix Viman Nagar which is much better managed.

I can only imagine the nightmare people have any emergencies might go through when on this road.

The parking facility within the mall is pathetic. I'm literally writing this review waiting in the queue to park my car as I have all the time in the world. My car just won't move.

ratna widhani,Local Guide ¬∑ 28 reviews ¬∑ 3 photos,2 stars,a year ago,"Hi Guys while most of the experience was decent ( mainly insignia) for other halls  one very big red flag is the food service when orders are to be delivered in the hall
I was watching kungfu panda in their Kiddies hall no 4 and had order 2 items to be delivered to the seat no. Note I had confirmed hall and seat nos twice at the food counter and I also made them write it on the bill
The movie ended and they never delivered my food worth 700 Rs.
Closer to the end of the movie when I enquired they said they delivered it to some "" sir"" ( note we were just 2 females )
Then I realised it was delivered to the wrong people who loved to enjoy free food at the cost of others.
Worse , the manager of this place Mahendra  Patil is clueless and has no manners to talk to a lady . He kept on asking me if I had received. the food and if I had told them the seat no correctly.
Not sure how he has been assigned as the manager.
His demeanor was so rude and casual as if nothing had happened and took forever to issue the refund as the food was of no use to me given the movie was over.
To add I could hardly see the movie towards the end properly given this incident. Overall very disorganised food court , poorly managed as even the billing takes so long given people are not properly trained to operate the billing counters .
