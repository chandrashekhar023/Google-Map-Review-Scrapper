Arun Kumar,"Local Guide ¬∑ 315 reviews ¬∑ 2,084 photos",4 stars,4 months ago,"I recently visited Phoenix Mall in Wakad and had a great experience overall. The mall is spacious, clean, and offers plethora of shopping options with aesthetic infrastructure. One can find  high-end brands to affordable choices. The food court has a good variety of eateries catering to different tastes, and the ambiance is lively.

The mall is easily accessible with ample parking space, which is a huge plus. The cinema experience here is also fantastic, and I enjoyed watching a movie in their comfortable theatres.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the crowd can sometimes be overwhelming, especially on weekends. It would be great if the management could work on crowd management during peak hours.

Only emergency exits are marked correctly. Entrance to the mall is blocked, pedestrians have very narrow passage for entry. You guys should see amanora and seasons mall, entry to the mall and parking management. They have big passages but block pedestrians from using them. All our people see is the interior but no one sees ease of parking and entry to the mall. The society in front has no parking boards, I see all the vehicles parked outside of the mall.

anil sharma,Local Guide ¬∑ 61 reviews ¬∑ 254 photos,4 stars,2 weeks ago,"I had visited Phoenix Mall of the Millennium in Wakad, Pune some time ago. It was a nice experience overall.

The mall is big, clean, and has a modern look. There are many shops for clothes, shoes, electronics, and more. I liked the variety of brands available ‚Äì from budget to premium. Overall it feels a little bit expensive. The food court is spacious and has many options like pizzas, burgers, Indian food, and desserts.

The mall also has a multiplex for watching movies and some fun play zones for kids. There are many places to sit and relax inside. The washrooms were clean and easy to find. Security and staff were helpful and polite.

Parking is available but it can get full on weekends. There was a bit of crowd, but the mall is large so it didn‚Äôt feel too packed.

Do‚Äôs:

-Wear comfortable clothes and shoes, as the mall is big and you may walk a lot.
-Visit during weekdays if you want to avoid the crowd.
-Keep your phone and wallet safe, especially in crowded areas.
-Try different food items in the food court ‚Äì there‚Äôs good variety.

Don‚Äôts:
-Don‚Äôt park in no-parking areas outside the mall ‚Äì you may get fined.
-Don‚Äôt bring big bags, as they may be checked at the entrance.
-Don‚Äôt litter. Use dustbins provided.

Improvements:
-The mall can improve by adding more sitting areas near shops.
-Signboards for directions inside the mall can also be clearer. -Some parts the AC was not working well.

Overall it is a great place for shopping, food, and fun with family or friends. And don't expect too many discounts.",,,,

Great ambiance with multiplex is all in one Stop destination for people. Nice decoration and plenty of sitting arrangement is appreciated üëç

Huge 6 floors of mall for shopping and entertainment. Sign board for washroom and elevator needs to improve as all folks don't understand the picture only. So there should be written signboard as well for suitable for all kinds of visitors.

Similar huge multi floor parking area with mechanical smart car parking system to accommodate many vehicles. Lots of food options indian, South Indian, north indian, fast food and other traditional maharashtrian and jain options are available. Big brands Pizza Hut, Domino's, McDonald's, Buggies burger, WOW Chinese, KFC and many more.

Only problem is narrow approach road to mall and residential area around makes lots of time waste in parking queues. Be aware unauthorised parking outside of the mall (2 W and 4W) end up in towing by Traffic.

The escalators are placed well. There is a good collection of items in various shops. Major shopping needs clothing, footwear, jewellery, electronics, can be fulfilled in this one place.
However, the mall parking, especially for the cars is a big no-no. It takes hours to get your car parked in the parking and same while you want to leave.

Only negative is that the seating in the food court. You need to wait a lot or kind of first cum first occupant for eating. If you go on the holiday or weekend then you had it for food.
Parking is congested but you will get a place. But when you are going out from the mall, its kind of traffic on the roads.

Vijay Verghis,"Local Guide ¬∑ 391 reviews ¬∑ 4,435 photos",4 stars,a year ago,One of the largest malls in pune at waked. They have spent a lot of attention to the interiors and yes it definitely looks and feels premium. They have a lot of brands here and some really good deals were on for the Christmas season. The food court has a variety of food options just like the other malls. The stand alone restaurants are only a few and I assume they are still to open. They have the time zone and fun city which are amazing entertainment options for your kids. Time zone has a 4 lane bowling track and some 3d games to play for both kids and adults. I have given them a 4 only because of the parking and bad management. Half the staff are not disciplined and with no training. It will be a mess and you will find the staff sending you in the wrong direction. Washrooms can be kept more cleaner. I believe they will eventually get it right. Good option to visit in the Pune Bangalore highway. Watch out for the traffic jams while entering and exiting the mall. I will visit again.,7,,,

Phoenix Mall of Millennium in Wakad is an amazing destination for shopping and leisure. The mall is huge with a beautifully designed interior, filled with stunning decor pieces that make for great photo spots. It's a visual treat for anyone who loves a well-done interior.

You‚Äôll find all the major brands here, like H&M, Adidas, Arrow, Azorte, Biba, Bluestone, Casio, Croma, Crossword, and many more. It's the perfect shopping destination, offering something for everyone. The food court is equally impressive, with a wide variety of food options from popular brands to choose from.

However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The parking situation for 4-wheelers can be a hassle, and the mall is almost always crowded. Weekends, in particular, are super busy, with heavy traffic and lots of people. If you want a more relaxed experience, it's best to avoid weekends.

1. Good place

My personal experience of wasting 30 min walking n searching for correct lift and the lift workers are so ride that they leave you at B1 and says take other lift or use staircase for B2 and offs the lift just to go from work and I'm left with serching for right lift going here n there as per the instructions of the mall workers.

Weekends are marred by chaos, primarily because of the congested approach roads and parking areas.

Inox Multiplex is one of the biggest in pune and have maximum number of screens around 18 screens.

They have multiple play areas for children

Misba Sayyed,Local Guide ¬∑ 86 reviews ¬∑ 225 photos,4 stars,a year ago,"A gigantic mall. A lot of brands and variety of food outlets are available here. A bit too crowdy on weekends as it is a new mall in the town. A bit tedious as parking for two wheelers have different entry. Water fountain, lightings, etc are very eye catchy and pretty. It looks very beautiful at night. The mall is huge so there is a lot of walking if you plan to bring senior citizens though there are a lot of resting / seating places available. Two game zones are available and perfect for kids. Washrooms are clean. The mall is very beautiful inside out.",3,,,

Nikita Mande,Local Guide ¬∑ 16 reviews ¬∑ 27 photos,4 stars,a year ago,"Hey everyone,
So....The Phoenix Mall of the Millennium is bit close to my heart as i have been the part of it's construction process in little bit mine contribution.
I visited the mall 2 days back and to say about the mall, it's just FAB üëå.
It's a 3-4 floor mall, with spectacular interior as well as the exterior of the mall.
At the entry of mall you will get to see the musical fountains which is a good attraction spot for audience.
To talk about Insight of mall, at every floor you will get a picture click spot.
Still the mall is not yet opened to full capacity but its a great place to hangout with friends.
Note: Don't visit the mall on weekends it's fully crowded.

Thanx üòä",,,,
Samadhan Sawant,Local Guide ¬∑ 92 reviews ¬∑ 456 photos,5 stars,a year ago,One of the Biggest malls in Pune. Still developing but you can visit here.

vishnu nair,Local Guide ¬∑ 24 reviews ¬∑ 6 photos,3 stars,5 months ago,"The mall is overall very good‚Äîclean, spacious, and has a great variety of shops to explore. It's a great place to spend time with family or friends.

However, one thing that disappointed me was the lack of seating arrangements. When visiting with elderly family members or even after walking and shopping for a while, it's essential to have a place to sit and rest. It's surprising and unfortunate that such a basic amenity is missing in a well-maintained mall like this. I hope the management considers adding seating areas for the convenience of visitors. It would make the shopping experience much better for everyone.",,Response from the owner,5 months ago,"Thank you for your review!

Abhijit Tapkire,1 review,1 star,3 weeks ago,"I visited the Reliance Trends store at Millennium Mall today and noticed that there was a huge crowd, especially at the billing counter. There was only one female cashier available who was handling everything alone, and as a result, the queue was long and customers were getting frustrated.
What disappointed me even more was when the cashier politely requested for more staff support, the manager reacted rudely instead of helping. As a customer, I found this very unprofessional and unfair towards both the staff and us waiting customers.
I request you to kindly look into this matter and ensure better staff management during busy hours. A little support and coordination can make the experience smoother for everyone.",,,,
